# Contact Requests Feature Implementation - Lessons Learned

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Database Security (RLS)

#### What Went Wrong
- Initially missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies on `contact_requests` table
- Complex permissions requirements: senders, recipients, and different status states
- Insufficient granular control over who could view/modify requests

#### Solution
- Implemented specific RLS policies for each action:
  - View: Users can only see requests they've sent or received
  - Create: Users can only create requests where they are the sender
  - Update: Recipients can only update status of requests sent to them
  - Delete: Only request senders can delete pending requests

### 2. Data Fetching Strategy

#### What Went Wrong
- Initially tried to fetch all data in a single complex query
- Poor error handling masked underlying issues
- No detailed logging to trace problems

#### Solution
- Split data fetching into logical steps:
  1. Fetch contact requests
  2. Extract sender IDs
  3. Fetch corresponding profiles
  4. Combine data using Map for efficiency
- Added comprehensive logging at each step
- Implemented proper error handling with specific error messages

### 3. Error Handling

#### What Went Wrong
- Generic error messages
- Silently failing operations
- Returning empty arrays instead of throwing errors

#### Solution
- Implemented specific error messages for each failure case
- Added proper error logging to console
- Used toast notifications with meaningful error messages
- Proper error propagation instead of silent failures

### 4. State Management

#### What Went Wrong
- Unclear loading states
- No handling of processing states for accept/reject actions
- Confusing UI feedback

#### Solution
- Added loading states for initial data fetch
- Implemented processing states for individual request actions
- Clear UI feedback for all user actions
- Proper state management for optimistic updates

## Best Practices Established

1. **Database Design**
   - Always implement RLS policies from the start
   - Test permissions with different user roles
   - Document access patterns clearly

2. **Error Handling**
   - Use specific error messages
   - Implement proper error logging
   - Provide clear user feedback
   - Never silently fail operations

3. **Data Fetching**
   - Break complex queries into manageable steps
   - Use efficient data structures for combining results
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Add comprehensive logging

4. **Testing Considerations**
   - Test with multiple user accounts
   - Verify all possible request states
   - Check error scenarios
   - Validate security policies

## Future Improvements

1. Implement real-time updates for request status changes
2. Add batch operations for handling multiple requests
3. Improve performance with pagination
4. Add more detailed analytics and logging
